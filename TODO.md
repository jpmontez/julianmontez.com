# TODO

- Add a gallery view for multi-photo posts.
  - This would only be utilized in a dedicated post page.
- ~~Add width/height or CSS aspect-ratio; ensure responsive sizing (max-width: 100%, height: auto).~~
- ~~Fix CLS from unsized images:~~
  - ~~Add intrinsic width/height/aspect-ratio for generated `<img>` tags (ideally using real image dimensions from static assets).~~
  - ~~Ensure CSS preserves responsive scaling without layout shift.~~
- ~~Add a main landmark (`<main role="main">`) around primary content for accessibility.~~
- Add sitemap.xml (with images) and robots.txt.
- Add canonical/meta updates and per-post meta descriptions.
- ~~Automate Lightroom JPG exports and initial post skeleton creation/boilerplate~~
- ~~Add lazy-loading to images.~~
- ~~Cleanup the URL slugs so that `index.html` is not visible.~~
- ~~Implement a CI/CD pipeline~~
